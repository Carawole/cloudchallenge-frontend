            <p>
                This website is running using AWS serverless cloud infrastructure and automated using a CI/CD pipeline that runs on Github Actions. The frontend is written with HTML, CSS and Javascript, deployed to an S3 bucket with enforced HTTPS using Cloudfront. The backend, which is defined in a Terraform image, consists of a REST API created using API Gateway and a Lambda function (running Python) that writes to a DynamoDB table.
