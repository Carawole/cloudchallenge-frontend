    <button onclick="dropDownCRC()">Cloud Resume Challenge</button>
    <div id="CRC">This website is the tangible outcome of my participation in the Cloud Resume Challenge, a rigorous project that pushed the boundaries of my cloud computing and web development skills. The challenge required creating a serverless web application hosted on AWS, with a focus on building a robust CI/CD pipeline. The website, crafted using HTML and CSS, is continuously deployed to an S3 bucket and distributed through a CloudFront CDN. Automation is at the heart of the backend infrastructure, orchestrated by a CI/CD pipeline powered by Github Actions. This pipeline deploys AWS resources managed by Terraform, ensuring the environment's consistency and efficiency while running Py unit tests for quality assurance. An AWS API Gateway facilitates the creation of a REST API, which, in turn, is supported by AWS Lambda functions written in Python, effectively managing updates to a DynamoDB table.</div>
    <button onclick="dropDownCU()">Connect-Us</button>
    <div id="CU">This project represents a significant extension of my capabilities, wherein I designed and implemented a robust authentication and authorization system using AWS to secure access to a private MySQL database containing sensitive patient information. Leveraging AWS Cognito for user authentication and authorization, the system ensures that only authorized personnel can access the patient data. User identities are managed securely, with multifactor authentication and role-based access control integrated seamlessly. The MySQL database itself is hosted in a secure VPC, and data is encrypted both in transit and at rest. This project not only demonstrates my expertise in implementing strong security measures for sensitive data but also showcases my proficiency in harnessing AWS services to build complex, real-world solutions.</div>
    <button onclick="dropDownMB()">Microblog App</button>
    <div id="MB">I embarked on a personal project to create a Microblog application with React and Flask, a journey that allowed me to explore the intricacies of both front-end and back-end development. This endeavor was a valuable opportunity for me to learn and grow as a developer. I also dived into the world of DevOps, containerizing the application using Docker and deploying it on Kubernetes. Leveraging the power of AWS, I ensured reliable and scalable hosting while maintaining a strong focus on security. This project, although a personal undertaking, represents my dedication to continually expanding my knowledge and skills in the ever-evolving landscape of web development and cloud infrastructure.</div>
